        "description": "Calcium is a soft, gray, alkaline earth metal that is never found in its pure form in nature due to its high reactivity. Instead, it occurs abundantly as compounds in minerals such as limestone, gypsum, and fluorite. Calcium plays a crucial role in many biological processes, including muscle and nerve function, bone formation and maintenance, and blood clotting. It is also an important element in many industrial applications, such as the production of cement, iron and steel, and fertilizers. Calcium is commonly added to foods and supplements to ensure adequate intake, particularly in individuals who are at risk of calcium deficiency. While calcium is essential for overall health, too much calcium can lead to negative health outcomes, including kidney stones and heart disease."
